# sample-openapi-sdk

## Overview

This project explores OpenAPI and what it can do to help solve these problems.

1. Provide a minimalist approach to generating API schema **models** (no API interfaces) and the full OpenAPI artifacts
2. How do we have a single API schema (models and service interfaces) to support multiple languages?
3. What build tools are available for this stack?
4. What build customizations will be needed to build, package, and distribute libraries?

## Programming Languages

Investigation will include generating share libraries for the following programming languages.

1. Java
2. React
3. Python
